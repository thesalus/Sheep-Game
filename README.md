# SHEEP

## Introduction
Sheep is an economics-based computer game played by 2 to 5 players. The goal of the game is to accumulate four different resources that can be used to buy various forms of capital, which can then be used to accumulate even more of the essential four resources. The winner of Sheep is the player with the most resources total at the end of the game (see Endgame).

## Getting Started
A game of Sheep begins in the “Known World”, the 6 by 6 tile grid at the centre of the game board, surrounded by the thick, black border. Players are randomly designated a starting tile within the 6 by 6 grid and a random resource type is assigned to each tile (see Resources). One sheep token is allotted to each player’s respective starting tiles. Each player is then given a total of 1000 resource points, which are distributed randomly amongst the four resource types.

## Taking a Turn
At the beginning of a turn, the active player collects 100 resource points for each resource tile of each resource type that he or she controls. The player is then allowed to “herd his or her sheep” in a manner of his or her choice (see below).

There are 5 possible way to herd sheep in the game Sheep:
1. Exploration,
2. Population,
3. Industrialization,
4. Globalization, or
5. Randomization.

To herd sheep with the Exploration action, a player selects an unexplored tile that is adjacent to a tile he or she already controls and places a sheep token of the player’s colour on it. A random resource type is then assigned to this tile.

To herd sheep with the Population action, a player selects an already explored resource tile that he or she controls and places an additional sheep counter onto the space. A tile with 2 sheep tokens produces 150 resource points every turn, instead of the regular 100. 3 sheep tokens on a single resource tile produce 175 resource points. And 4 or more sheep tokens on a resource tile produce 200 resource points per turn.

To herd sheep with the Industrialization action, a player selects an already explored resource tile that he or she controls and convert that tile into the capital tile of his or her choice. The player must meet all requirements for the creation of the new capital tile (see Capital).

To herd sheep with the Globalization action, a player selects another player with whom to trade with. There are no limits to what can be traded. Anything can be traded in Sheep!

To herd sheep with the Randomization action, a player selects a card from the top of the “Holy Sheep!” deck of cards and follows the instructions printed on it.

In a single turn, a player may either Explore once and Populate once, Explore once and Industrialize once, Globalize once, or Randomize once, unless instructed to do otherwise by a Holy Sheep! card.

## Resources
There are four essential resources in Sheep that must be collected by players using sheep tokens and resource tiles in order to herd their sheep: Very Green Grass, Grub, Anthonium Ore, and Tender Love and Care. The names of these four resource types have absolutely no significance to the game of Sheep. They are just silly.

## Capital
There are four forms of capital that can be purchased in Sheep, which can significantly improve on the resource-collecting capacities of sheep tokens and resource tiles: Very Green Grass Mines, Grub Replicators, Anthonium Ore Farms, and Sheep Online Dating Services. Each piece of capital costs 500 resource points of their respective resource types to build and must be constructed on a resource tile of the appropriate resource type, which already holds 4 sheep tokens. A capital tile produces 300 resource points every turn.

## Endgame
A game of Sheep ends when all tiles have been explored. The player with the most cumulative resources wins the game.
