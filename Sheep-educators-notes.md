## SHEEP Educator’s Notes

## Introduction
Sheep is a stimulating economics experience for your child or student, incorporating many facets of micro- and macroeconomics into a fun and easy-to-play package. The sheep themselves represent a sort of labor as they produce goods and services that can be exchanged.

## Basic Principles
The main objective in the game “SHEEP” is to acquire resources. This can be achieved by one of the five main actions:
1. [Exploration](#Exploration),
2. [Population](#Population),
3. [Industrialization](#Industrialization),
4. [Globalization](#Globalization), or
5. [Randomization](#Randomization).

### Exploration
Exploration is the process by which new land is found. In the real world most of the available land has been discovered, but in the land of SHEEP the vast majority of the tiles begin undiscovered. As such, players can lay claim to the land and place sheep on them. The cost of land is rent, but as the players own the land themselves they do not need to actively pay anything out. The land provides resources, which is expressed as a value rather than an absolute quantity.

## Population
Population occurs when a player places sheep on a tile that he or she controls. Land on its own cannot supply resources-labor is required. The cost of labor is wages, but in this case sheep are docile animals and only require grass to operate: conveniently enough, this can be found on the land itself and thus to the player the labor is ‘free.’

Population also shows the effects of diminishing marginal returns. The first sheep that the player puts on the tile increases production by 100; the second by 50; the third by 25, the fourth by 25, and any more sheep do not increase production at all.

## Industrialization
However, if the player has four or more sheep on the tile, the player can industrialize! Industrialization in this case means the purchase of new capital, which requires resources. Different plants require different resources as represented by the costs in different resources. Purchasing new capital and getting a new plant allows the player to have different short-run costs. The player takes a risk in buying capital in that he or she must ensure that the cost of doing so will be made back in profits.

## Globalization
Globalization is the game’s take on trade. Trade in SHEEP currently does not offer economic advantages as it should, as creating a system with absolute and comparative advantages would have been beyond the scope of the programming abilities of the team that created SHEEP. However, there is an advantage to trade in that players who wish to purchase capital but do not have enough of the required resource can acquire it from a trading partner. Look for absolute and comparative advantage in future editions of SHEEP!

## Randomization
Randomization allows the player to draw a card that will initiate a random event of economic significance. Some of the cards are purely for the advancement of gameplay, but others have effects that reflect economic principles. These cards are as following:

**Card Name**: Sheep Mania
> **Effect**: Mattel Inc releases a new line of Barbie Sheep, increasing the demand for sheep in general. Each piece of land contributes 10% resources point for a bit.
> 
> **Economics**: Change in consumer tastes caused an increase in demand. Consumers want resources that are produced by sheep! It’s like the organics craze, except without any sense or logic. Supply stays constant, so there is an increase in price and the player’s resources appreciate in value for the duration of the change in consumers’ tastes.

**Card Name**: Mad Sheep Disease
> **Effect**: The Japanese decide to close their borders due to Ovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, so demand for sheep decreases. Each piece of land contributes 25% less resource points for a bit.
> 
> **Economics**: Similar to “Sheep Mania,” except there is a negative change in consumer tastes and demand decreases, which leads to a decrease in prices as supply stays constant.

**Card Name**: Sheep Market
> **Effect**: Name a resource type. If no other player owns a land of that resource type, you possess a monopoly. Each land you possess of that type contributes 10% more resource points for a bit.
> 
> **Economics**: This card reflects the economic phenomenon known as a monopoly! In this case the player can only use the card if he or she controls a resource with no close substitutes: for the purposes of this game no resource has a close substitute. Because of the complete control of that one good (in this case, a resource) the player can inflate its prices and make greater profits. While this prevents efficient use of resources, the player has no incentive to do so and is therefore free to rake in the money.

**Card Name**: Microsoft Sheep Inc. 
> **Effect**: Microsoftsheep has bought up the competing sheep buyers, creating a monopsony. Each piece of land contributes 10% less resource points for a bit.
> 
> **Economics**: By buying up all the buyers of sheep resources, Microsoftsheep has created a monopsony. By removing competition for the resources, Microsoftsheep has the freedom to set prices and thus sets them below the marginal cost of resources, which leads to the player who is selling those resources earning less profit.

**Card Name**: Black Sheep Friday
> **Effect**: As sheep stocks crash, people pull money out of their banks to pay their debts. Interest rates increase by 5%.
> 
> **Economics**: When people pull their money out of banks, the supply of currency available for loans decreases. 

**Card Name**: Xenophobic Sheep
> **Effect**: Uncertainty in the US dollar has caused the value of the Canadian dollar to skyrocket. Thus, the effective price of the sheep has increased, so demand decreases. Each player receives 10% less resource points for each tile for a while.
> 
> **Economics**: The increase in the value of the Canadian dollar has increased the effective price of the Canadian-produced goods. The increase in perceived supply curve causes a decrease in the quantity demanded, leading to less profit for the producers who do not receive the higher price.

**Card Name**: Sheepen Harper’s Fiscal Policy
> **Effect**: Sheepen Harper decides to decrease the income taxes on the resources of the sheep. Each player receives 10% more resource points for each tile for a while.
> 
> **Economics**: This card simulates the role of government in the economy, that of the reallocation of resources. Here, the government has spontaneously decided that resources are better kept in the pockets of the producers, and so the producers do not have to pay as many taxes on their incomes, which is reflected by an increase in effective income.

## Debt
All players start the game with 2000 in debt of a generic currency. They are free to pay it off at any time but there is an interest rate (that fluctuates) that increases the amount they owe with each turn. Players must make decisions based on the anticipated length of the game to determine when they want to pay off their debts.
